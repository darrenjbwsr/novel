9-20-23: Set up Docker, using React front-end, postgres-database, FastAPI back-end. Currently using a migrations-based database, might consider changing later on. Currently working on sign-in and create account feature to get the ball rolling on back-end, hoping to use jwt authorization. For front-end, trying to create the essential pages to link from the landing page. Then CSS needs to be rolled out to get the layout to match Figma represntation. Once basic features are working, I'll try to start rolling out APIs for the questions and build forms for them on the front-end. Also made a cute little book icon in figma and transfered it as an SVG file.
